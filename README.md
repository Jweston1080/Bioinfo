In this document, we will discuss multiple different questions pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Tasks 1 and 2 will go over the different methods of computationally discovering frequent k-mer patterns. The algorithims of counting these patterns will be implemented through the FrequentWords() and BetterFrequentWords() approaches. Task 3 will allow us to generate random DNA sequences of various lengths. Task 4 will provide graphs for the runtimes of the algorithims implemented in Task 1 and 2, which will be compared. Task 5 will use our algorithims to report the most frequent k-mers of varrying sizes in the coronavirus 2 genome. Finally, Task 6 will allow us to determine which genes certain k-mers belong to and whether or not they are in an intergeneic region.
