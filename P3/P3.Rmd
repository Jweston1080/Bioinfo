# **Abstract**



# **Methods**

Describe the data structures and algorithms that you have designed.
Describe how to compile your code.
Describe how to run your code to reproduce the results in your report.


# **Results**
Visualize obtained trees and sequences in Task 4.
Visualize obtained trees and sequences in Task E1 if you choose to do it.
Report the runtime for Task 1 to 4.

Task 1 runtime: 0.00 seconds
Task 2 runtime: 0.50 seconds



# **Discussion**
Answer Task 5 here.
Answer Task E2 here if you choose to do it.


# **Distribution**
For each team member, report the memberâ€™s contribution to coding, testing, or debugging as related to each task. Each member must do about an equal portion of work. A student with less programming background may do relatively less complex coding, but it is unacceptable that a member does no coding. E.g., Task 1 is a good piece for a non-computing background student.
Each team member needs to describe the writing done, and must contribute to the writing of the final report.
Each team member needs to report the time spent on the project. This is best done by creating a log of time and activities every time you work on the project.
